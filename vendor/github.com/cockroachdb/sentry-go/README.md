# Official Sentry SDK for Go

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/getsentry/sentry-go.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/getsentry/sentry-go)

`sentry-go` provides a Sentry client implementation for the Go programming language. This is the next line of the Go SDK for [Sentry](https://sentry.io/), intended to replace the `raven-go` package.

> Looking for the old `raven-go` SDK documentation? See the Legacy client section [here](https://docs.sentry.io/clients/go/).
> If you want to start using sentry-go instead, check out the [migration guide](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/go/migration/).

## Requirements

We verify this package against N-2 recent versions of Go compiler. As of September 2019, those versions are:

* 1.11
* 1.12
* 1.13

## Installation

`sentry-go` can be installed like any other Go library through `go get`:

```bash
$ go get github.com/getsentry/sentry-go
```

Or, if you are already using Go Modules, specify a version number as well:

```bash
$ go get github.com/getsentry/sentry-go@v0.3.0
```

## Configuration

To use `sentry-go`, youâ€™ll need to import the `sentry-go` package and initialize it with the client options that will include your DSN. If you specify the `SENTRY_DSN` environment variable, you can omit this value from options and it will be picked up automatically for you. The release and environment can also be specified in the environment variables `SENTRY_RELEASE` and `SENTRY_ENVIRONMENT` respectively.

More on this in [Configuration](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/go/config/) section.

## Usage

By default, Sentry Go SDK uses asynchronous transport, which in the code example below requires an explicit awaiting for event delivery to be finished using `sentry.Flush` method. It is necessary, because otherwise the program would not wait for the async HTTP calls to return a response, and exit the process immediately when it reached the end of the `main` function. It would not be required inside a running goroutine or if you would use `HTTPSyncTransport`, which you can read about in `Transports` section.

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "os"
    "time"

    "github.com/getsentry/sentry-go"
)

func main() {
  err := sentry.Init(sentry.ClientOptions{
    Dsn: "___DSN___",
  })

  if err != nil {
    fmt.Printf("Sentry initialization failed: %v\n", err)
  }
  
  f, err := os.Open("filename.ext")
  if err != nil {
    sentry.CaptureException(err)
    sentry.Flush(time.Second * 5)
  }
}
```
