# Changelog

## Unreleased

- "I am running away from my responsibilities. And it feels good." â€“ Michael Scott, Season 4, "Money"

## v0.3.1

- feat: Send extra information exposed by the Go runtime (#76)
- fix: Handle new lines in module integration (#65)
- fix: Make sure that cache is locked when updating for contextifyFramesIntegration
- ref: Update Iris integration and example to version 12
- misc: Remove indirect dependencies in order to move them to separate go.mod files

## v0.3.0

- feat: Retry event marshalling without contextual data if the first pass fails
- fix: Include `url.Parse` error in `DsnParseError`
- fix: Make more `Scope` methods safe for concurrency

- ref: Change `SampleRate` type to `float64`
- doc: `Scope.Clear` not safe for concurrent use
- ci: Test sentry-go with `go1.13`, drop `go1.10`

_NOTE:_
This version removes some of the internal APIs that landed publicly (namely `Hub/Scope` mutex structs) and may require (but shouldn't) some changes to your code.
It's not done through major version update, as we are still in `0.x` stage.

## v0.2.1

- fix: Run `Contextify` integration on `Threads` as well

## v0.2.0

- feat: Add `SetTransaction()` method on the `Scope`

- fix: Add `RWMutex` locks to internal `Hub` and `Scope` changes

## v0.1.3

- feat: Move frames context reading into `contextifyFramesIntegration` (#28)

_NOTE:_
In case of any performance issues due to source contexts IO, you can let us know and turn off the integration in the meantime with:

```go
sentry.Init(sentry.ClientOptions{
	Integrations: func(integrations []sentry.Integration) []sentry.Integration {
		var filteredIntegrations []sentry.Integration
		for _, integration := range integrations {
			if integration.Name() == "ContextifyFrames" {
				continue
			}
			filteredIntegrations = append(filteredIntegrations, integration)
		}
		return filteredIntegrations
	},
})
```
